# SteamVR Launcher from Mixed Reality

This simple application uses the Steam protocol extension to launch SteamVR from a Windows Mixed Reality Environment.

## How to install:

Microsoft will not allow Apps in the store that launch other Apps unless that other App is also in the store. SteamVR is not in the Microsoft Store so this App will not be approved. To get around this, you will have to sideload the app.

You have two choices to install:
- Build the code yourself, no other steps needed, other than to enable developer mode in Windows 10. If you are building the code
you know how to do that.
- If you don't want to build the code yourself.
    1. download the latest build from the Release tab.
